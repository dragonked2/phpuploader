# Simple File Uploader

A simple web application that allows users to upload files to a server using PHP.

## Description

This web application provides a basic file uploader that allows users to select a file from their local machine and upload it to the server. The uploaded file is then moved to a specified upload directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your web server.
2. Ensure that your server meets the minimum requirements: PHP 7.2 or higher, and a compatible web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
3. Set up the necessary permissions for the upload directory to allow file writes by the web server.
4. Access the application through your web browser (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/fileupload.php`).
5. Use the file input field to select a file from your local machine.
6. Click the "Upload" button to upload the selected file.
7. Wait for the upload process to complete.
8. If successful, you will see a "File uploaded successfully!" message. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.

## Customization

- **Upload Directory**: Modify the `$uploadDirectory` variable in the PHP code to specify the directory where uploaded files should be stored.
- **Styling**: Customize the HTML and CSS to match your preferred design.

## Security Considerations

- This is a basic file uploader and does not implement advanced security features. It is recommended to add additional security measures based on your specific requirements, such as input validation and sanitization.
- Ensure that the upload directory has proper permissions and is protected from unauthorized access.
